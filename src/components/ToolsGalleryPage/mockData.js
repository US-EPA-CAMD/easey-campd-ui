          This web mapping application provides improved estimates of the
          dependence and spatial distribution of housing units reliant on
          private domestic wells by census block group and block. Nationally,
          based on an understanding of well use from state well logs and the
          housing unit density, an estimated 23 million housing units are being
          served by this water resource, 17 per cent of the population. In 1990,
          15.1 million households were reliant on wells. In the ensuing 30 years
          there has been over a 50 percent increase in the number of households
          relying on these wells. This dataset will assist in a better
          understanding of the reliance on private domestic wells in the US,
          better positioning local, state, and federal groups in protecting this
          water resource from contaminant sources. Manuscript for more

          This dashboard provides EPA and states information on each state's
          readiness to implement electronic reporting based on ICIS-NPDES data.
          The purpose of the dashboard is to help states identify data points
          that need attention as electronic reporting of DMRs is phased in (see
          data sharing requirements in 40 CFR 127.26). EPA will build additional
          charts and data visualizations over time to make it easier to evaluate
          NPDES Electronic Reporting Rule implementation. In particular, EPA
          will provide new charts on how well states are sharing NPDES program
          data with EPA's ICIS-NPDES [see 40 CFR 127.23(b)]. Please contact
